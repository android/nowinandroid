We reduced the CPU time used by core system services, added performance class device capabilities, made ML accelerator drivers updatable outside of platform releases, and prevented apps from launching foreground services from the background and using notification trampolines to improve performance. The new Privacy Dashboard, approximate location, microphone and camera indicators/toggles, and nearby device permissions give users more insight into and control over privacy. We improved the user experience with a unified API for rich content insertion, compatible media transcoding, easier blurs and effects, AVIF image support, enhanced haptics, new camera effects/capabilities, improved native crash debugging, support for rounded screen corners, Play as you download, and Game Mode APIs.",

Deploy Preview deploys snippets of your Compose code to a device or emulator for quick testing. Layout inspector now works with apps written fully in Compose as well as apps that have Compose alongside Views, allowing you to explore your layouts and troubleshoot. With Live Edit of literals, you can edit literals such as strings, numbers, booleans, etc. and see the immediate results change in previews, the emulator, or on a physical device — all without having to compile.\n",
