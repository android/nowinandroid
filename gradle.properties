# Specifies the JVM arguments used for the daemon process.
# The setting is particularly useful for tweaking memory settings.
# Ensure important default jvmargs aren't overwritten. See https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/19750
#
# For more information about how Gradle memory options were chosen:
# - Metaspace See https://www.jasonpearson.dev/metaspace-in-jvm-builds/
# - SoftRefLRUPolicyMSPerMB would default to 1000 which with a 4gb heap translates to ~51 minutes.
#   A value of 1 means ~4 seconds before SoftRefs can be collected, which means its realistic to
#   collect them as needed during a build that should take seconds to minutes.
# - CodeCache normally defaults to a very small size. Increasing it from platform defaults of 32-48m
#   because of how many classes can be loaded into memory and then cached as native compiled code
#   for a small speed boost.

# For more information about how Kotlin Daemon memory options were chosen:
# - Kotlin JVM args only inherit Xmx, ReservedCodeCache, and MaxMetaspace. Since we are specifying
#   other args we need to specify all of them here.
# - We're using the Kotlin Gradle Plugin's default value for ReservedCodeCacheSize, if we do not then
#   the Gradle JVM arg value for ReservedCodeCacheSize will be used.
