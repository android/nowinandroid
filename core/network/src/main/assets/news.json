We reduced the CPU time used by core system services, added performance class device capabilities, made ML accelerator drivers updatable outside of platform releases, and prevented apps from launching foreground services from the background and using notification trampolines to improve performance. The new Privacy Dashboard, approximate location, microphone and camera indicators/toggles, and nearby device permissions give users more insight into and control over privacy. We improved the user experience with a unified API for rich content insertion, compatible media transcoding, easier blurs and effects, AVIF image support, enhanced haptics, new camera effects/capabilities, improved native crash debugging, support for rounded screen corners, Play as you download, and Game Mode APIs.",

In addition, Play Console users can request access to actions with a justification, and we‚Äôve introduced permission groups to make it easier to assign multiple permissions at once to users that share the same or similar roles.",

In December 2021, we are starting to roll this feature out to devices with Google Play services running Android 6.0 (API level 23) or higher for apps targeting Android 11 (API level 30) or higher. Users can manually enable permission auto-reset for apps targeting API levels 23 to 29.\nSome apps and permissions are automatically exempted from revocation, like active Device Administrator apps used by enterprises, and permissions fixed by enterprise policy. If your app is expected to work primarily in the background without user interaction, you can ask the user to prevent the system from resetting your app‚Äôs permissions.",
